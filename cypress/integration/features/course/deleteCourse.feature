Feature: To delete the course created for testing purpose

    As a teacher I want to delete the newly created test course/room so that list of courses/rooms can be cleaned and not full with test courses/rooms

    #Scenario: Deleting the test course/room created during executing the testing
        #Given I am logged in as a 'teacher' at 'brb'
        #When I go to rooms overview
        #And I go to room 'Kurs Cypress Testkurs'
        #Then I should be able to delete the test room
        #Then I do not see the course 'Kurs Cypress Testkurs' on the room overview page
