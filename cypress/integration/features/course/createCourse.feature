Feature: To add a new course by the teacher

    As a teacher I want to create a new course so that I can teach and provide online course related work to the students

   # Scenario: Adding a new course
        #Given I am logged in as a 'teacher' at 'brb'
        #When I go to rooms overview
        #And I click on FAB to create the course
        #And I fill out the course creation form for new course 'Cypress Testkurs'
        #And I click on next steps
        #Then I see the course 'Cypress Testkurs' on the room overview page
