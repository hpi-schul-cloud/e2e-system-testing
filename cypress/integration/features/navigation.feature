Feature: To check navigation in sidebar

    As a user I want to check navigation in sidebar so that I can make sure all features are there

#Scenario: Check navigation in sidebar as admin
        #Given I am logged in as a 'admin' at 'brb'
        #When I go to rooms overview
        #When I go to teams overview
        #When I go to files overview
        #When I go to personal files overview
        #When I go to course files overview
        #When I go to team files overview
        #When I go to shared files overview
        #When I go to news overview
        #When I go to calendar overview
        #When I go to LernStore overview
        #When I go to administration page
        #When I go to student administration
        #When I go to teacher administration
        #When I go to course administration
        #When I go to class administration
        #When I go to team administration
        #When I go to school administration
        #When I go to help section in sidebar
        #When I go to help articles in sidebar
        #When I go to contact in sidebar
        #When I go to advanced trainings in sidebar
        #Then I would need a final confirmation

#Scenario: Check navigation in sidebar as teacher/student
        # they see less entries than the admin
        # teacher only sees student, teacher and class administration
        # so we could check that some entries aren't there
        # also they something the admin doesn't
        # When I go to tasks overview
        # other differences
        # When I go to addons overview (only nbc)
