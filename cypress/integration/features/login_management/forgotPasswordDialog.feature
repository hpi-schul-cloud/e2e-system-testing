Feature: Visibility of dBildungscloud Password Reset dialog

  As a user (teacher or student or admin), I want to see password recovery dialog box visible to me so that I can recover my password in case needed.

  #Scenario: User sees password recovery dialog
    #Given I am on the dBildungscloud login page
    #When I click on Forgot Password
    #Then I see the Reset Password dialog

  #Scenario: Entering email or user name is mandatory
    #Given I am on the dBildungscloud login page
    #When I click on Forgot Password
    #When I clear email section and submit the request
    #Then I still see the email input box that request is not submitted
