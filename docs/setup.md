3. **Setting Up Environment Variables for Testing User Credentials and URLs**
   <br>

   - Duplicate [devClusterTemplate.env.json](../env_variables/devClusterTemplate.env.json) file and rename the duplicated file to `local.env.json` in the env_variables folder.
     - Test data on development clusters are created using school API.
   - Duplicate [stagingTemplate.env.json](../env_variables/stagingTemplate.env.json) file and rename the duplicated file to `staging.env.json` in the env_variables folder.
     - Test data on the staging environment is fetched from the seed data on the server.
   - Add your credentials and environment-specific variables to `local.env.json` and `staging.env.json` from 1Password including api keys.
     - Remember to add all instances, as in 1Password, we have different vaults available for each namespace.
     - Contact the QA team for the required 1Password links.
